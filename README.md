The Automated Waste Collection System is an innovative, sustainable solution designed to modernize traditional waste management through advanced technology. By integrating sensor-equipped bins with a central data platform, the system monitors waste levels in real time, ensuring that collection occurs only when bins are full. This smart approach reduces unnecessary pickups, minimizing fuel consumption and cutting down on carbon emissions. Additionally, optimized route algorithms streamline collection paths, saving time and operational costs for waste management services.
